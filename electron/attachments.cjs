/**
 * Image attachment persistence for composer pastes/drops.
 *
 * The renderer hands us a processed image as a data URL; we write it into a
 * dedicated temp directory and return the absolute path so the prompt can
 * reference it as an @-mention. discard() only ever unlinks files inside that
 * directory, so a compromised or buggy renderer cannot delete arbitrary paths.
 *
 * The directory lives in the shared temp dir under a predictable name, so it
 * is kept owner-only (0o700) and a symlinked root is refused outright: writes
 * must never be redirected and discard()'s path boundary must stay real.
 *
 * Kept free of `require('electron')` so it can be unit-tested under plain Node;
 * main.cjs injects the attachments directory.
