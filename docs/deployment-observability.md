# Deployment Observability

Start with the human release checklist in [`releasing.md`](releasing.md). This
document records the deeper controls, trust boundaries, and operational checks.

This project observes release readiness through GitHub Actions, verified build
artifacts, updater configuration, private crash intake, and local runtime logs.

## Pre-release signal checklist

Before cutting or promoting a desktop build, verify the latest default-branch CI run is green for:

- Frontend tests
- Sidecar tests
- Frontend typecheck
- Sidecar typecheck
- Electron syntax
- Production build
- Format check
- Documentation check

The CI workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Each job uses Node.js 22 and runs the same commands documented in `README.md` and `AGENTS.md`.

## Deployment configuration to capture

Record these values with each release candidate:

| Variable | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| `DROIDEX_UNSIGNED_RELEASE_BUILD` | Enables the fail-closed unsigned website release configuration |
| `DROIDEX_RELEASE_BUILD` | Enables the fail-closed signed/notarized release configuration |
| `CSC_LINK` | Developer ID Application certificate supplied through CI secrets |
| `APPLE_API_KEY_P8_BASE64` | Base64-encoded App Store Connect key materialized as a temporary `.p8` file in CI |
| `APPLE_API_KEY_ID` / `APPLE_API_ISSUER` / `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | Apple identities used for notarization and signature verification |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | Public client DSN embedded for crash and `/bug` reporting |
| `SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY` | EdDSA private key used only in protected release automation to sign unsigned-app update feeds and ZIPs |
| `DROIDEX_RELEASE_TOKEN` | Fine-grained token with Contents write and Administration read access only to the public releases repository |

The current `macos-release` GitHub environment requires `SENTRY_DSN`,
`SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `DROIDEX_RELEASE_TOKEN`. Add the Apple credentials
only when the workflow is deliberately converted to the future Developer ID
path. The environment's deployment policy admits `v*` tags only and disables
administrator bypass. The workflow also requires the tagged commit to be
exactly versioned and already contained in `origin/main`. Keep real secrets out
of release notes and CI logs. The release token is exposed only to public
release-repository checks during preflight, the final publish step, and
marker-gated failed-draft cleanup. Source-repository checks continue to use the
workflow's scoped token.

Release secrets also require a real approval boundary. Before pushing a release
tag, configure a required environment reviewer and protected `main`/tag rules.
If the repository plan cannot enforce those controls, keep release-capable
write access owner-only or remove the release secrets between supervised
releases. A `v*` deployment policy limits eligible refs; it does not stop a
write collaborator from changing a workflow.

Run `npm run release:preflight:unsigned` for the current free distribution path.
It verifies both repository identities and visibility, immutable public releases,
the unsigned disclosure, exact remote commit, Sparkle configuration,
architecture-specific signed feeds, checksums, DMGs, packaged native modules,
and canonical SQLite schema.

Run `npm run release:preflight` before a future Developer ID release. It verifies the
repository identity and visibility, immutable release policy, environment tag
protection, secret names (never values), local Developer ID identity, workflow
syntax, exact `origin/main` commit, and fully verified local artifacts. Any
failure blocks tagging.

## Canonical release path

The current website release is ad-hoc signed, but it has no trusted Developer ID
signature and is not notarized. It does not require an Apple Developer Program subscription. Build with
`DROIDEX_UNSIGNED_RELEASE_BUILD=1`, inject `SENTRY_DSN` from protected release
configuration, generate both Sparkle appcasts with `npm run sparkle:appcast`,
and run the unsigned preflight. Publish only these immutable public assets:

- `droidex-arm64.dmg` and `droidex-x64.dmg`
- `droidex-arm64.zip` and `droidex-x64.zip`
- `appcast-arm64.xml` and `appcast-x64.xml`
- `SHA256SUMS`

The website should link Apple-silicon users to the arm64 DMG and Intel users to
the x64 DMG. Because the app is not Developer ID-signed or notarized, the first
launch requires the user to approve DROIDEX in macOS System Settings > Privacy
& Security > Open Anyway.
The DMG includes an **Open Privacy & Security** shortcut beside the Applications
alias. After macOS blocks the first launch, users can double-click that shortcut
to open the required settings pane directly; macOS still requires the user to
click **Open Anyway** and authenticate.
That friction is intentional until Developer ID signing and notarization are
enabled.

Sparkle 2.9.5 is downloaded from its pinned official release and verified by
SHA-256 during the build. Each architecture reads only its matching HTTPS
appcast. The appcast and enclosed ZIP are signed with DROIDEX's EdDSA key;
release verification checks both signatures against the public key embedded in
the app. DROIDEX may check for updates in the background, but it never downloads
or installs an app update without the user choosing the update action.
Keep the private key only in the macOS Keychain and the protected
`macos-release` GitHub environment.

`.github/workflows/release-macos.yml` is the only production publisher. A tag
whose name exactly matches the source package version and is already
contained in `main` runs all release gates, builds the ad-hoc-signed Intel and
Apple silicon packages, signs both Sparkle appcasts, verifies the artifacts,
and generates `SHA256SUMS`.

The workflow publishes these files to the public
`droidex-anas/droidex-releases` repository in one `gh release create`
operation. GitHub creates a draft, uploads exactly the two DMGs, two ZIPs, two
appcasts, and `SHA256SUMS`, compares every remote digest with the local file,
and publishes only after verification succeeds. Enable immutable releases on
that public repository so published tags and assets cannot be replaced. The
repository itself contains only public download documentation. Its automatic
source archives contain only that documentation, never the application source.

A future Developer ID release must deliberately convert this same workflow to
the signed/notarized `DROIDEX_RELEASE_BUILD=1` path and run
`npm run release:preflight`. That path uses `latest-mac.yml` and blockmaps for
electron-updater. Do not enable the free Sparkle and paid Developer ID paths for
the same tag.

Do not attach `builder-debug.yml`, source maps, `.env` files, certificates, or
source archives. Electron application JavaScript shipped inside the
DMG remains inspectable by users; keep secrets and privileged server logic out
of the client.

## Runtime health checks

After installing a candidate build:

1. Launch the app and confirm the renderer loads.
2. Complete onboarding or confirm existing settings load.
3. Start a Droid session and verify sidecar connection status.
4. Confirm CLI discovery or installation works on a clean machine.
5. Confirm the macOS menu exposes Check for Updates, Privacy & Security,
   standard Edit actions, safe Reload actions, Window actions, and Help. Packaged
   builds must not expose Developer Tools.
6. Trigger an update check against the public releases repository.
7. Inspect Electron and sidecar logs for bridge authentication, download, or update errors.
8. On the oldest supported macOS release, double-click the DMG's Privacy &
   Security shortcut and confirm it opens the correct system pane.

Before promoting every update after the first release, install the previous
public version on a clean test account and confirm it discovers the
architecture-matched appcast, verifies the signed ZIP, installs, and relaunches
into the candidate version. The first release has no N-1 candidate; it instead
requires native Sparkle-load, signed-feed, signed-archive, and packaged-runtime
verification. A future Developer ID release additionally requires Gatekeeper,
notarization, and stapling checks.

The direct-download app is not App Sandbox–restricted. It asks macOS for access
to Desktop, Documents, or Downloads only when the user selects a protected
project location. Camera, microphone, Accessibility, Screen Recording, and
Apple Events permissions are not requested because current DROIDEX features do
not use those system capabilities.

The sidecar uses Electron's bundled Node 22 runtime and its built-in
`node:sqlite`; users do not install or download SQLite. The canonical session
database is `$DROIDEX_USER_DATA_DIR/state/droidex.sqlite` (default
`~/Library/Application Support/DROIDEX/state/droidex.sqlite`). Schema
`user_version` is `1`. It is the sole application source of truth for session
summaries, private provider bindings, children, turns, and transcripts.
Provider-native files under `~/.factory/sessions` are resume-only and are never
imported. A mismatched or corrupt database fails with its path and the recovery
action `move or remove this file, then restart DROIDEX`. DROIDEX does not
rebuild that file from Factory history.

## Crash and bug intake

Sentry captures uncaught main/renderer/native crashes and sidecar exits. The
`/bug` and `/feedback` composer commands open the private feedback form. A
successful submission creates a sortable `RPT-…` report ID that remains visible
and copyable until the user dismisses the receipt. DROIDEX shows that receipt
only after Sentry returns the same event ID that DROIDEX submitted. This confirms
that Sentry accepted the envelope, not that it has already been indexed or shown
in a particular Issues filter. Missing or mismatched acknowledgments, network
failures, timeouts, rate limits, and server errors keep the form open with its
entered details for retry.

Manual reports use an explicit payload allowlist. They contain the details and
category selected by the user, the report ID, a stable pseudonymous `USR-…`
installation ID, app version, macOS version, CPU architecture,
Electron/Chromium/Node versions, and packaged status. DROIDEX does not attach
chats, prompts, project files or paths, browser content or history, logs,
environment variables, API keys, GitHub credentials, network requests, or
breadcrumbs to manual reports. The UI states this boundary before submission.

Crash reporting retains exception messages and stacks plus the default Electron
runtime, device, screen, GPU, module, source-context, ANR, and crashed-URL
diagnostics needed to debug failures. Native crashes can include minidump
attachments, whose process-memory snapshot may contain incidental sensitive
data. Requests, breadcrumbs, and user fields other than the pseudonymous local
profile ID are removed from JavaScript crash events. Default PII and performance
tracing remain disabled, but those controls do not make crash artifacts free of
incidental sensitive data. Restrict Sentry project access to release/incident
operators and configure retention in Sentry before public distribution.

Packaged app launches also create Sentry Release Health sessions. DROIDEX loads
the stable pseudonymous installation ID before Sentry starts, so Release Health
can report app sessions, unique active local profiles, crash-free sessions, and
observed version adoption without intentionally collecting account identity or
product activity. A profile is one Electron user-data directory: it can survive
an app update or reinstall, resets when that directory is removed, and is not a
person or physical-device count. Treat the first release observed for a profile
as its first observed version and a later release only as that same profile being
active on a later version. Development sessions are isolated under the
`development` environment and must not be included in production usage counts.

Automatic diagnostics are enabled by default in release builds and disclosed in
the README and **Settings → Privacy & diagnostics**. Changing the preference
restarts DROIDEX so the Electron SDK initializes exactly once before app
readiness. Disabling closes the Sentry client and deletes the local profile ID.
Explicit `/bug` and `/feedback`
submissions remain available because they are sent only after the user reviews
the manual-report boundary and chooses Submit; while automatic diagnostics are
disabled, each report uses a report-scoped ID that is not persisted locally.

Sentry is operational observability, not product analytics. DROIDEX does not use
Sentry messages as analytics events and does not track clicks, prompts, commands,
project names, file paths, browser activity, or session content. Add a dedicated
privacy-reviewed analytics system before measuring feature funnels or retention.

Connect the private Sentry project to the source repository using Sentry's
server-side GitHub integration and an issue alert rule. No GitHub token belongs
in the DMG. Upload private source maps from release CI only; never attach source
maps to the public GitHub release.

## Incident triage

If a deployment causes user impact:

1. Stop promotion of the current release candidate.
2. Capture OS version, app version, CPU architecture, and the public release tag.
3. Reproduce with `npm run electron` when possible.
4. Run the relevant runbook in `docs/runbooks.md`.
5. File the fix with the failing CI command and observed runtime log excerpt.

## Missing observability

Product analytics and release notifications are not configured. If either is
added, link the private dashboard and alert channel here and update
`docs/runbooks.md` with escalation steps.
